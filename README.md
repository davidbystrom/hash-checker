## Introduction
This is a program that validates SHA256 hashes of programs against the hash collected by the user online.

## Usage
1. Download the binary for your operating system (Windows/Linux)
2. Run the program against the file and hash you want to compare by typing:
    * For Windows: ```./hash-checker.exe <path to file for comparrison> <SHA256 hash to compare>```
    * For Linux: ```./hash-checker <path to file for comparrison> <SHA256 hash to compare>```
3. Se if the hash matched or not. (WARNING! IF THE HASH DO NOT MATCH DO NOT START THE PROGRAM!)
